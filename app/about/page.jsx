      <p className="indent-5 mb-2">
        Born in 1961 Northern Michigan, Troy Large began his life wondering
        about the mysterious phenomena & the abundatant amount of amazing things
        around him the world had to offer.
      </p>
      <p className="indent-5 mb-2">
        Books did not only become a joyful part of his life but also a necessity
        in it. He read more and more every day until information literally could
        no longer be stored until rest was had. This cycle repeated every day.
